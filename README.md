## Introduction
This project is to design a performance forecasting model for the singer "ISAAC," predicting his growth over the next five years (2024-2029) on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. The ISAAC performance forecasting model aims to predict the future trajectory of his music career, focusing on YouTube and Spotify metrics. The result will guide investment decisions for a company seeking to capitalize on ISAACâ€™s potential growth.

## Setup and Installation
To run the model locally, follow these steps:

1. Install python3.11.9.
2. Set up Jupyter Notebook development environment (pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels prophet)
3. Clone this repository.
4. Download dataset

## Run the code
After installing everything, you just need to run the main.ipynb to get the forecasting results of ISAAC's performance on Spotify and YouTube. 
(P/s: I have converted the data from spreadsheet to CVS format.)

#### To run, follow these 4 steps:
